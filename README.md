Tic-Tac-Toe
Creating a Tic Tac Toe game with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is an excellent way to hone web development skills while building a fun and interactive application. This project involves designing a 3x3 grid using HTML for the game board, styling it with CSS to ensure a visually appealing layout, and implementing game logic with JavaScript to handle player interactions. Players take turns clicking on the grid cells to place their marks (X or O), and the JavaScript code checks for win conditions or a draw after each move. The game provides immediate feedback by highlighting the winning combination or indicating a draw, and it includes a reset feature to start a new game. This project not only reinforces the basics of web development but also introduces fundamental programming concepts such as event handling, conditional statements, and DOM manipulation.
